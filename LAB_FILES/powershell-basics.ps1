# Module - PowerShell Basics
# URL: 

# Note: Some demo commands have been modified to work within the lab environment. They will perform the same general tasks, but may have different references such as file directories. Also, any tasks requiring internet access will be skipped.
# Note: Use of cls in code is to clear-host or clear the screen during demos. This can be skipped during your labs if desired.

# Demo: 
# Run these commands in Windows PowerShell
# In this Lab, you will learn how to use various commands in PowerShell to explore the console, and find the information you are looking for. PowerShell's command line interface is built to provide you the information you need through exploration and use of the commands in the console. Using this exploratory approach will deepen your understanding of how PowerShell works and allow you to find answers without always searching on the web for them.
#In this challenge, you will walk through the demo from the beginning of the course. The demo walks you through creating a .csv report of all the stopped services on a remote server. While you may not know what the commands are doing yet, this will get you hands on with PowerShell, and get you practice typing commands into the console.

#cd c:\scripts\m1

# Introduction to PowerShell
# Demo: Using PowerShell to Report on Stopped Server Services

#Open Windows PowerShell
# Right-click on choose 'Run as administrator' on desktop icon

# Run these commands in Windows PowerShell console

# View all services on local system                                                                                                                         
Get-Service

# View stopped services
get-service | where-Object Status -eq 'Stopped'

# View only Name and Status for stopped services                                                  
get-service | Where-Object Status -eq 'Stopped' | select-object Name,Status 

# Place command output in a variable
$data = get-service | Where-Object Status -eq 'Stopped' | select-object Name,Status 
$data

# Note the difference between the output files of the two commands below
# Output variable data to a .csv file
$data | out-file .\services.csv                  
notepad .\services.csv                                                                                               

# Export variable data to a .csv file
$data | export-csv .\Services2.csv
                    
get-content .\services2.csv | more  

# demo: Exploring PowerShell Verbs
In this first challenge, you will explore get-verb from the PowerShell console. PowerShell uses a Verb-Noun syntax so it's important that you learn the common verbs in PowerShell like get and set. 
Remember in PowerShell: Almost everything you need to know, you can find out through the shell. Just type and Explore.
Note: In this challenge, you will be using PowerShell 7, not Windows PowerShell.
You will start by accessing Client01 through <x>. On the desktop of client01, open the Labs folder and open lab-challenge-02.ps1 in Visual Studio Code.
Starting in Client01, click on the Window icon in the lower left corner and type PowerShell to display PowerShell 7 (x64) in the start menu.
Right-click the PowerShell 7 (x64) icon and choose More > Run as administrator to launch the Windows PowerShell Console.
Right-click the menu bar of the the console window and choose Properties to configure the PowerShell console window.
This will allow you to change many aspects of the console to enhance your experience. Changes made to the console will rename part of your user profile.
In the Windows PowerShell Properties window, click the Font tab, choose a larger font of 28, and click OK to apply the changes.
In the console window, type the following command to list all of the verbs available in the Windows PowerShell console, and click the space bar to scroll through each screen
get-verb | more
The command includes | more so all of the output can be reviewed one screen at a time. If you need to exit the output, you can use Ctrl+C to go to the prompt.

#Type the following command to view all of the commands in PowerShell using the Set verb.
get-verb -Verb Set | more
In the command output, you will see the default formatting of output is as a table.

#Type the following command to view all of the commands in PowerShell using the set verb and in a list format.
get-verb -Verb Set | format-list
In this command, you pipe "|" the output of the command into format-list to display the output as a list. 

#Type the following command to view all of the verbs that are part of the Security group.
Get-Verb -Group Security | Format-List
Note: The -group parameter is only available in PowerShell 7 so it will not work if you are using Windows PowerShell.

#Type Exit to close the PowerShell 7 console, or leave it open if you plan to do the next challenge.

# Congratulations! You've completed your first exploration of the PowerShell console using get-verb. Get-verb is a great tool for finding the verbs used by PowerShell, and it will help you as you explore more commands available in PowerShell.
